There are a handful of basic terraform commands, including:

    terraform init
    terraform validate
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    terraform destroy

These commands make up the terraform workflow that we will cover in objective 6 of this course. It will be beneficial for us to explore some basic commands now so that work alongside and deploy our configurations.
